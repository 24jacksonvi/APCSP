  <p>the 2022-2023 school year was super fun and interesting but at the same time very stressful. I did very well in lots of my classes but not as well in others. I really enjoyed computer science as it was very interesting and I learned many different and fun topics such as HTML and Python and all about Algorithmic thinking and AI. Overall I think I am an academic weapon and I enjoy learning</p>
